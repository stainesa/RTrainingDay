# RTrainingDay

This provides a relatively self-contained (with sample datasets included) one-day course for complete beginners in R, built up from the tidyverse. There is some debate as to whether one should teach R from base-R or the tidyverse. Our approach is to stay inside the tidyverse, but to point to other materials. A defining trait of R is TMTOWDI (there's more than one way to do it), but for beginners this is neither sensible nor feasible. People can learn it later, and they will, if they need to.

# What do we cover?

* Loading data from Excel or a CSV.
* Loading R packages and using libraries.
* Data summaries (summary, describe).
* Doing your own summaries (mena, median, ...) with dplyr.
* Wide and long data (very briefly).
* Tables in dplyr and printing them in knitr.
* An example of building up a plot from very simple to quite appealing.
* Linear regression (very simply)
* Pulling it togeher with a second example.

## Sample data
We use two sample datasets.
* OECD data on practising nurses per 1,000 population
** (https://stats.oecd.org/ OECD.Stat database)
* Data on years of potential life lost from the Big Cities collaboration
** (Big Cities data from https://bigcitieshealthdata.org/)
